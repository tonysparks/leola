Leola Programming Language

The Leola Programming Language was created on April 1st, 2010.  It wasn't created out of frustration with existing languages nor for a niche requirement.  It was simply created because I find programming languages and compilers interesting.  
  							
If you are looking for an expressive, performant and/or robust programming language, chances are you will be more than happy with other more mature languages such as Python, Ruby or Lua.  If you just want to try and learn a new programming language for fun, please continue on reading!
								
My main goal for Leola is to scratch my itch for learning more about compilers and language theory.  In addition, I also like to use it for my personal use -- therefore I have a vested interest in making it performant, stable and feature rich.
		  					
Leola is a dynamically typed language which supports Object Orientated Programming, Data Driven Programming and a splash of Functional Programming.  It can be embedded into a Java program or can be executed as a stand alone application.  It is written in the Java programming language and is compiled to Leola bytecode.  Yes, as it stands this is a VM on top of a VM.  A C VM implementation is planned, but currently not available.
